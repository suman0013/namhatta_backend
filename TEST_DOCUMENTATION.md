# District Supervisor Assignment - Frontend Testing Documentation

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive testing documentation for the District Supervisor Assignment feature implementation in the Namhatta Management System.

## Test Coverage Summary

### ✅ **All Tests Passing: 12/12 tests completed successfully**

## Test Categories

### 1. Role-based Assignment Logic Tests
**Coverage**: Auto-assignment and permission validation
- ✅ **Auto-assignment for District Supervisors**: Validates that district supervisors are automatically assigned to namhattas in their district
- ✅ **District Validation**: Ensures district supervisors can only create namhattas within their assigned district

### 2. Address Pre-filling Logic Tests  
**Coverage**: Dynamic form behavior based on user roles
- ✅ **Readonly Field Logic**: Verifies correct field locking for district supervisors (country, state, district)
- ✅ **Address Pre-filling**: Validates automatic address population for district supervisor users

### 3. Supervisor Selection Logic Tests
**Coverage**: District-based supervisor filtering and validation
- ✅ **District Filtering**: Tests supervisor list filtering by selected district
- ✅ **Cross-validation**: Ensures selected supervisor belongs to the namhatta's district

### 4. Form Validation Logic Tests
**Coverage**: Required field validation and business rules
- ✅ **Required Fields**: Validates all mandatory fields (code, name, secretary, district supervisor)
- ✅ **Sequential Dependencies**: Ensures district must be selected before supervisor selection

### 5. State Management Logic Tests
**Coverage**: Form state consistency and updates
- ✅ **Supervisor Reset**: Validates supervisor selection resets when district changes
- ✅ **State Preservation**: Ensures supervisor selection persists when district remains unchanged

### 6. Error Handling Logic Tests
**Coverage**: User feedback and error messages
- ✅ **Error Messages**: Validates appropriate error messages for different scenarios:
  - Missing district selection
  - No supervisors available
  - Loading states
  - Required field validation

### 7. Data Transformation Logic Tests
**Coverage**: API payload preparation
- ✅ **Role-based Data**: Tests correct payload transformation for different user roles
- ✅ **Auto vs Manual Assignment**: Validates proper supervisor ID assignment logic
